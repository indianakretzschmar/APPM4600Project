This paper explores Newton’s Descent and optimization. Utilizing principles of numerical analy-
sis, we will derive the method, discuss its strengths, limitations, and convergence properties, and
then its Quasi variations, Lazy Newton and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, now exclusively
referred to as BFGS. Through numerical experimentation, we evaluate the methods’ performance
across different multivariate cost functions and their corresponding nonlinear systems.
